Necessary additions for integration into Octant as a plug-in

Finding the root of the file structure has not been implemented, currently it is hardcoded in and passed into the WalkMatch function

Javascript is not supported in Octant and as such does not allow much of the JS based feactures to work properly

The proper Go plugin driver program to call the plugin will need to be implemented or a way to initiate the plugin to pull files and build the mind map.
